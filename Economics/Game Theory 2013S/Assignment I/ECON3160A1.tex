    \item[2.2]{\bf Answer:}\\
       Let's use some annotation:\\
       In my choices, we denote `C' is choice that I decide to practice Chopin piece for two weeks; `MC' as practice the piece of Mozart for one week and the piece of Chopin for the other, etc.\\
    As for the jury, `MC' means he(she) decides to ask you to play the pieces of Mozart and Chopin in the exam, etc.\\

    {\bf (b):}My rational choices are \{M,C,R,MC\}.\\
    The choice `M' is optimal holding the belief that the jury will pick `MC' with a possibility of $\frac{1}/{3}$, and will pick `MR' with a possibility of $\frac{2}{3}$.\\
    The choice `C' is optimal holding the belief that the jury will pick `MC' with a possibility of $\frac{1}/{2}$, and will pick `CR' with a possibility of $\frac{1}{2}$.\\
    The choice `R' is optimal holding the belief that the jury will pick `CR'.\\
    The choice `MC' is optimal holding the belief that the jury will pick `MC'.\\
    My irrational choices are \{MR,CR\}.\\
    The choice `MR' is dominated by the randomized choice, say, I will choose `M' with a possibility of 0.749, and `R' with a possibility of 0.251.\\
    The choice `CR' is dominated by the randomized choice, say, I will choose `M' with a possibility of 0.5, and `R' with a possibility of 0.5.\\

    {\bf (c):}Jury's rational choices are \{MC,CR\}.\\
    The choice `MC' is optimal holding the belief that my selection is `M'.\\
    The choice `CR' is optimal holding the belief that my selection is `C'.\\
    Jury's irrational choices are \{MR\}.\\
    It's dominated by the by the randomized choice, say, choosing `MC' with a possibility of 0.499, and `CR' with a possibility of 0.501.\\

    {\bf (e):}
    Under the belief of jury's rationality, my rational choices would be \{`C', `R', `MC'\}.\\
    Obviously, choices `MC' and `MR' can't be such rational choices for me.\\
    For my choices `C' , `R' and `MC', the arrows from them lead only to rational jury's choices, say, `MC', `CR' and `CR' respectively.\\
    Since one of the forked arrows from my choice `M' leads to the jury's irrational choice `MR', we need to find if there is any belief that can justify it. Unfortunately, there isn't. So, `M' is not a rational choice believing jury's rationality.\\\\
    {\bf (f):}
    Under the belief of jury's rationality, my rational choices would be \{`C', `R', `MC'\}, which is identical to result of (e).\\
    First, we eliminate all the irrational choices of mine(`MR' and `CR') and the jury's(`MR'). In the truncated game, the table of gains above now becomes the follow:\\

    `C' can be justified by the the belief that jury will choice `MC' and `CR' both with the possibility of 0.5. Thus it's rational (under the belief that jury will choose rationally).\\
    `R' can be justified by the the belief that jury will choice `CR'.\\
    `MC' can be justified by the the belief that jury will choice `MC'.\\
    However, my choice `M' is strictly dominated by the choice `C' now. Thus it's irrational.\\

    \item[2.4]{\bf Answer:}\\
    Denote \{{\it color 1},{\it color 2}\} as my opponents' choice combination (or my belief of their choice combination) that Barbara chooses color 1 while Chris choose color 2.\\
    {\bf (a):}
    Holding the belief that my Barbara and Chris both will pick up brown (\{brown, brown\}), I would get utility of 3, 6, 2, 5, 0 ,4, choosing white, red, blue, green, brown, black respectively. Thus {\it red} is optimal choice for me, and it's justified as rational choice. \\
    Under the belief of \{brown, red\}, my utility would be 3, 0, 2, 5, 0 ,4, choosing white, red, blue, green, brown, black respectively. In this case, {\it green} is optimal choice for me, and it's justified as rational choice.\\
    Under the belief of \{red, green\}, my utility would be 3, 0, 2, 0, 1 ,4, choosing white, red, blue, green, brown, black respectively. In this case, {\it black} is optimal choice for me, and it's justified as rational choice.\\
    Things is a little bit different to justify {\it white}:\\
    Under the belief of \{$\frac{1}{3}$red+$\frac{1}{3}$green+$\frac{1}{3}$black, $\frac{1}{3}$red+$\frac{1}{3}$green+$\frac{1}{3}$black\}, which denotes the belief that both of Barbara and Chris will choose red, green and black by the possibility of $\frac{1}{3}$, my utility would be 3, $\frac{8}{3}$, 2, $\frac{20}{9}$, 1 ,$\frac{16}{9}$, choosing white, red, blue, green, brown, black respectively. In this case, {\it white} is optimal choice for me, and it's justified as rational choice.\\

    {\bf (b):}Both of the choices is strictly dominate by my randomized choice of: ($\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{80}$)red+($\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{80}$)green+($\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{80}$)black+($\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{80}$)white. That is, to choose red, green, black, white with a possibility of $\frac{43}{240}$, $\frac{17}{80}$, $\frac{21}{80}$, $\frac{83}{240}$ respectively($\frac{43}{240}+\frac{17}{80}+\frac{21}{80}+\frac{83}{240}=1$). Let's denote it as the {\it choice D}. We can argue for its strict domination like this:\\
    No matter we choose {\it blue} or {\it brown}, we would not get a utility larger than 2. On the other side, for the {\it choice D}, at least two of the four colors are NOT the choices of Barbara's or Chris'. Because
    \begin{align}
    \frac{43}{240}\cdot 6&>1\\
    \frac{17}{80}\cdot 5&>1\\
    \frac{21}{80}\cdot 4&>1\\
    \frac{83}{240}\cdot 5&>1
    \end{align}
    for any of my opponents' choice combination, my utility would be greater than 2 pick up the randomized {\it choice D}.\newpage

    \end{center}
    {\bf (d):}
    First, my choice of {\it red} and {\it green} are justified first because the arrows from them lead to rational choices of my opponents.\\
    Since at least one of the forked arrows from my choices {\it white} and {\it black} lead to my friends' irrational choices {\it red} or {\it green}, we need to find if there is other belief that can justify it. Unfortunately, there isn't. So, {\it white} and {\it black} are not rational choices believing my friends' rationality.\\\\
    {\bf (e):}After the elimination of irrational choices of mine and my friends', the expected utility of YOU would be:

     *note: the ($u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4$) denotes I will get $u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4$ in the particular case, if I choose {\it white, red ,green, black} respectively.\\
     It's easy to get from the table that {\it green} strictly dominate {\it white} and {\it black}. And {\it green} are justified by the belief of \{{\it blue},{\it red}\}, {\it red} are justified by the belief of \{{\it blue},{\it blue}\}. So, the rational choices of mine are {\it red} and {\it green} holding the belief of my opponents' rationality.\\\\

     \item[2.5]{\bf Answer:}\\
     Let $C_B$ denotes the choice of Barbara and $C_C$ denotes the choice of Chris. $C_B, C_C\in$\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}, where 1 represents the choice of {\it a}, 2 represents the choice of {\it b}... etc.\\
     {\bf (a):}My rational choices are \{{\it b,c,d,e,f}\}.
     Holding the belief Barbara will choose {\it a} and Chris will choose {\it g}, the number of fathers I will get is 150, 300, 300, 300, 300, 300, 150 if I choose {\it a, b ,c, d, e, f, g} respectively. Thus {\it b,c,d,e,f} are all optimal holding this belief, and they are rational.\\
     My irrational choices are \{a,g\}. Without loss of generality, we try to prove choosing {\it b} strictly dominates {\it a}.\\
     If both of my opponents choose {\it c} or location in the right of {\it c}. The number of fathers I will attract is $\text{Min}\left\{C_C,C_B\right\}\cdot 50$ if I choose {\it a} and is $\text{Min}\left\{C_C,C_B\right\}\cdot 50+50$ if I choose {\it b}. Obviously, {\it b} is better.\\
     For other combinations we can compare the number of customers using the following table (the left of each cell is the expected number of fathers with location {\it a}, and the right of it is with {\it b}):\\

        \end{tabular}
     \end{center}
     In each case, choosing {\it b} will attract more customers. Thus, we have proved that {\it a} is an irrational choice. Since its symmetry, {\it g} is irrational as well.\newpage

     Since all the arrows from the choices {\it b, c, d, e, f} reach my opponents' rational choices, all of {\it b, c, d, e, f} are consistent with the belief of my opponents' rationality.\\\\

    {\bf (a):}For wagon, no matter which road it chooses, no one can block it. Choices in $W_1, W_3$ are strictly dominated by the choice $w_1$. Choices in $W_2$ are strictly dominated by the choice $w_2$. Wagon's choice $w_1$ is strictly dominated by the choice $w_2$. So, $w_1$ is rational while $w_2$ is irrational.\\
    Similarly, truck's rational choices are $t_2$, $t_3$; Maserati's rational choices are $m_2, m_3, m_5$.\\
    {\bf (b):}\begin{center}
                    \includegraphics[angle=0, width=0.7\textwidth]{ECON3160A1P8}\\
     \end{center}
    {\bf (c):}$t_2, t_3$ are rational choices consistent with the belief of opponents' rationality.\newpage
    {\bf (d):}The truncated game, my(Maserati) utility would be determined by the follow form:\\
    \begin{center}
         % Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Sheet4'
% Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Question3'
\begin{tabular}{rrccc}

{\bf Wagon:D-G-H} &            &  \multicolumn{ 3}{c}{{\bf Maserati}} \\

           &            &  A-C-D-G-H &  A-C-E-G-H & A-C--D-F-H \\

\multicolumn{ 1}{c}{{\bf Truck}} &    C-D-F-H &         40 &         22 &         34 \\

\multicolumn{ 1}{c}{{\bf }} &    C-D-G-H &         40 &         22 &         25 \\

\end{tabular}

    \end{center}
    The number in each cell is the total time needed to reach point {\it H}. My utility would be something negative to them. Since we use vNM utility, we only need to minimize the time. 
    Choices left above are the choices you can rationally choose, holding the belief of opponents' rationality.

\subsection{Graduate Thesis: Starburst Migration and Technology Diffusion}
This paper is tutored by \href{http://wulemin.weebly.com/index.html}{Prof. Lemin WU}. 
\begin{description}
\item[Fields:] Economic History
\item[Abstract:] We identify and models four types of historical migrations, which differ along two dimensions: 1) migration to/in equilibrium, and 2) whether technology diffuses with migration. 
The taxonomy accounts for the variation in both the spatial scope and the temporal persistence of the migrations. This paper mainly focuses on the first type, the one always coming together with rise and fall of civilizations: we call it starburst migration.

\subsection{SogouIndex}
Sogou is a popular SE(search engine) in China (with a market share of 10\%). Just as Google Trends and BaiduIndex, SogouIndex tries to measure popularity of given keywords based on the searching behavior of its users. This program will download SogouIndex automatically for given keywords, and stored them in .xlsx files.

The demo of this program is done during my internship at T.H.Capital, Jul. 2014. We are using searching indexes to predict the sale volume of upcoming cellphone, the numbers of visitors to Macau, etc.

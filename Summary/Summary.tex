\subsection{Undergraduate Thesis: Starburst Migration and Technology Diffusion}
\begin{description}
\item[Advisor:] \href{http://wulemin.weebly.com/index.html}{Prof. Lemin WU}. 
\item[Fields:] Economic History
\item[Abstract:] This paper shows how migration responds to technology shock in a historical context. Historical migrations appear lack of common laws because there are actually four types of them, which we distinguish along two dimensions, i.e. whether the migration is to equilibrium or in equilibrium, and whether technology diffuses along with migration. We model each type of migration and explain the direction, distance and duration of a wide range of migration events, including the exodus out of Africa, the spread of Neolithic culture, and pre-modern European rural-urban migration. {\it \href{http://shenghao.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/2/1/24218782/writingsample2migration_shenghao.pdf}{Fulltext}}\\

This project is led by \href{http://en.nsd.edu.cn/article.asp?articleid=6962}{Prof. Yang Yao} and \href{http://www.xitianyang.com}{Prof. Tianyang Xi}. We construct a dataset covering the personal characters of world political leaders, and start to do some empirical research on it.
\begin{description}
\item[Fields:] Political Economy
\item[Dataset Coverage:] The data set is intended to cover all countries that were or would become independent at any time after 1917, each from the inception of the first representative institutions or from the date of independence, whichever comes first, through 2010.
\item[Codebook and Coding Notes:] \href{http://shenghao.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/2/1/24218782/leaderships_and_political_selection-codebook.pdf}{Codebook}, \href{http://shenghao.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/2/1/24218782/notesofupdate.pdf}{Notes}
\item[Introductory Slides:] \href{http://shenghao.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/2/1/24218782/leadership_1950-2010-patterns.pdf}{Slides}

\subsubsection{Proposal under this project}
\begin{description}
\item[TV and Leaders:] We are interested in the rationality of voters(upon leaders' age and appearance) and will use the exogenous shock of media's introduction(e.g. TV).
\item[Bonds and Leaders:] We are interested in the relation between the rank of sovereign funds and corresponding leaders' personal characters.

Capital is an independent research and investment advisory firm specializing in China. It offers real-time, on-the-ground, bottom-up research across a wide spectrum from macro and industry analysis to company specific projects; from China ADRs to international names that have meaningful exposure to China market. \\
My responsibility mainly lies in two field: 1) processing data collected by computer engineer and support analysis; 2)Develop new products.

\subsection{SogouIndex}
Sogou is a popular SE(search engine) in China (with a market share of 10\%). Just as Google Trends and BaiduIndex, SogouIndex tries to measure popularity of given keywords based on the searching behavior of its users. This program will download SogouIndex automatically for given keywords, and stored them in .xlsx files.

The demo of this program is done during my internship at T.H.Capital, Jul. 2014. We are using searching indexes to predict the sale volume of upcoming cellphone, the numbers of visitors to Macau, etc. 

More details could be reached at GitHub: \url{https://github.com/Hari-Sheng/SogouIndex}
